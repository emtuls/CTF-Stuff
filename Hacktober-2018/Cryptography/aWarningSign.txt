They were able to add what we think might be a hint but the writing looks broken. 

Hint -     re do it by     changing all numbers that are greater than one. 

Hint2 - Some might say this challenge has been a mystery. Others might use a synonym.

Decoded message will not be in the format flag-XXXX but you can submit it either in its decoded form with spaces, as flag-XXXX where the decoded message is one continuous string, or as one long continuous string. All are acceptable formats.
