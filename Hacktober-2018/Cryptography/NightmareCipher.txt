While monitoring the site looking for clues one a detective noticed the following numbers etched into the wall by one of the victims.

While sitting at his desk the detective realized it was a cipher-text and was able to decipher the message which lead to the capture of the serial killer.

Flag is NOT in the format of flag-xxxxxx but will involve distinct words. These can be either separated by an underscore or by spaces - you can submit either format.
